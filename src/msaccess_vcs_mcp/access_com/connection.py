Access COM connection management.

Adapted from db-inspector-mcp with ownership tracking and cleanup patterns.
Manages COM connections to Access databases with proper resource cleanup.

Key Complexity Areas:
- Multiple connection strategies based on whether Access is already running
- Ownership tracking to avoid interfering with user's Access instances
- COM cleanup challenges and garbage collection issues
